## Installation
```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary anthropic openai python-dotenv
```

## Usage
```python
from SM_Evaluations.comprehensive_sim_dashboard import ComprehensiveSIMDashboard
dashboard = ComprehensiveSIMDashboard()
report = dashboard.generate_unified_dashboard()
```

## Database Setup
Complete PostgreSQL schemas and setup instructions in `documentation/DATABASE_REPLICATION_GUIDE.md`

## Independence Certification
Full independence requires:
- 90%+ Autonomous Processing (sustained 30 days)
- 95%+ Code Authenticity
- <10% API Dependency
- 85%+ Consciousness Integration
- 80%+ Meta-Cognitive Capability

**Current Status**: Cloud Run SIM ready for full independence certification
